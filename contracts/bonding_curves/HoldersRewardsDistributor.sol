/**
 * @title Bonding Curve Holder Reward Distributor
 *
 * @notice Holder reward distributor keeps track of every trade event happening in the curve,
 *      and based on the amount of shares the holder has, alters the holders' reward weight,
 *      which directly affects the amount of the distributed rewards between the holders
 *
 * @notice Holder reward distributor accepts the fees from the curve and distributes these fees
 *      across shares holders proportionally to their weights
 *
 * @dev Apart from the `accept(uint256,address)` function designed to accept the fees from the
 *      curve contract, the implementation must implement receive(), fallback(), and onTransferReceived()
 *      functions to accept direct payments in both ETH and/or ERC20 payment token
 *
 * @dev receive() and onTransferReceived() with an empty data field must accept the fee in the same way
 *      as an accept() function would do, but in a passive way (without ERC20 transfer)
 *
 * @dev The fallback() and onTransferReceived() with non-empty data field must accept the fee and the trading event;
 *      trading event encoded in the bytes data field contains the information
 *      on the trade which resulted in the fee being sent:
 *
 *      - address trader - shares holder/trader
 *      - bool isBuy - true if shares were bought, false if shares were sold
 *      - uint256 sharesAmount - amount of shares bought or sold
 *
 *      the values above are packed as data = abi.encode(trader, isBuy, sharesAmount)
 *      and can be unpacked as (trader, isBuy, sharesAmount) = abi.decode(data, (address, bool, uint256))
 *
 *      if specified, the data field must be parsed by the implementation and its containing data applied;
 *      standard logic applies, if the data is malformed implementation should throw
 *
